# Kicho

Kicho is a command-line workflow manager for LaTeX research projects.

It aims to support the entire lifecycle of mathematical writing, from project creation to journal submission, while remaining compatible with standard LaTeX workflows.

The current version provides project initialization, building, cleaning,
environment diagnostics, project validation, source transformations, snapshots,
and local submission packages.

## Features

### Current

- Create a new LaTeX research project
- Choose an English or Japanese built-in paper template
- Build the project using `latexmk`
- Clean generated build files
- Check the local environment with `doctor`
- Validate project files and references with `check`
- Create source, PDF, and metadata snapshots with `archive`
- Split explicitly marked source blocks with `split`
- Flatten full-line `\input` and `\include` commands with `flatten`
- Create a local submission package with `submit`
- Show command-specific help with `help COMMAND`
- Show command-specific help with `COMMAND --help`
- Built-in help (`--help`)
- Version information (`--version`)

### Planned

- More complete TeX-aware transformations
- Submission profiles
- Project management utilities

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yoshito-ishiki-math/kicho.git
cd kicho

chmod +x bin/kicho
```

---

## Quick Start

Create a new project.

```bash
./bin/kicho init MyPaper
```

Create a Japanese LuaLaTeX project using `jlreq`, LuaLaTeX-ja, and the
Harano Aji fonts included with TeX Live.

```bash
./bin/kicho init --template japanese MyJapanesePaper
```

Move into the project directory.

```bash
cd MyPaper
```

Build the project.

```bash
../bin/kicho build
```

Clean generated files.

```bash
../bin/kicho clean
```

Diagnose the installed toolchain, then validate the project without building.

```bash
../bin/kicho doctor
../bin/kicho check
```

Create a snapshot of the source, compiled PDF, and project metadata.

```bash
../bin/kicho archive
```

Show available commands.

```bash
../bin/kicho --help
```

---

## Testing

Install the development-time shell linter on macOS.

```bash
brew install shellcheck
```

Then run the complete lint, syntax, and integration test suite from the
repository root.

```bash
bash tests/run.sh
```

Pushes and pull requests run the same suite on macOS 14 with the system
`/bin/bash` to preserve Bash 3.2 compatibility.

## Generated Project Structure

```
MyPaper/
├── main.tex
├── preamble/
├── sections/
├── bib/
├── figures/
├── build/
└── .latexmkrc
```

---

## Workflow

Kicho is designed around the following workflow.

```
init
 ↓
write
 ↓
build
 ↓
split
 ↓
flatten
 ↓
archive
 ↓
submit
```

Current releases implement the basic project commands, archive snapshots,
marker-based splitting, safe flattening, and local submission packages.

---

## Philosophy

Kicho is not simply a LaTeX template.

Its goal is to provide a reproducible and lightweight workflow for mathematical writing while remaining close to standard LaTeX tools such as `latexmk`, LuaLaTeX, and Biber.

Rather than replacing existing tools, Kicho integrates them into a consistent project workflow.
